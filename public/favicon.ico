The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon for the website. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon.ico file separately. 

Please ensure to place your favicon.ico file in the specified directory: /logistics-app/logistics-app/public/favicon.ico.
